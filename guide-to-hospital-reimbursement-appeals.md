## Overview

Proper Medicare reimbursement is crucial for hospitals. It fuels their ability to provide high-quality care, invest in cutting-edge technology, and attract skilled staff. The complexities of Medicare cost reporting, however, can lead to denials and discrepancies, thus threatening financial stability.

Hospitals facing cost report denials often embark on a challenging appeals process. Stringent deadlines, precise discrepancy documentation, and well-supported arguments are all essential for success. However, navigating the legalities, reimbursement calculations, and intricate Medicare regulations can be overwhelming.

## Understanding Cost Report Appeals

Hospitals rely on Cost Reports to secure fair Medicare reimbursement. These reports outline the costs incurred during healthcare service delivery and are crucial in determining payment for treating Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare intermediaries review the submitted Cost Reports for accuracy and may request additional documentation.

The reviewed Cost Report, along with established payment policies, ultimately determine a hospital's current reimbursement. However, the significance of Cost Reports goes beyond immediate financial impact.

The data they contain, when combined with information from Medicare Parts A & B (MedPar), builds a critical foundation. This combined dataset informs Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) when setting future payment rates and making policy decisions regarding Medicare reimbursement.

### Protested Amounts

Hospitals can dispute disallowed costs through "protested amounts." The hospital includes these costs on the Cost Report (usually on Worksheet E) as allowable under Medicare. Hospitals should preserve appeal rights by either claiming the cost as allowable or "self-disallowing" it, providing an explanation and estimated reimbursement amount. This ensures the ability to fight for these costs later, even if initially denied.

### Amendments vs. Reopenings

Navigating Cost Report adjustments can involve two key options: amendments and reopenings. While both aim to rectify errors, they differ in purpose and timing:

#### Amendments

Amendments are ideal for addressing material errors identified **before** the official Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR) is issued. These errors must significantly impact the hospital's reimbursement.

Common reasons for amendments include miscalculations or incorrect application of specific cost reporting rules, like Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) adjustments. Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may decline amendments unless they significantly affect reimbursement.

#### Reopenings

The provider, CMS, or the MAC can initiate reopenings. They are allowable **within three years** of the NPR being issued, providing a broader window for addressing errors. If fraud is suspected, there's no time limit for requesting a reopening.

## The Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) Appeals

The Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) is an independent panel that settles hospital reimbursement disputes. Established by federal law, the PRRB has five members with expertise in healthcare and finance. Hospitals can appeal decisions, including final Cost Reports, quality program payment reductions, and even inaction from Medicare contractors.

### Filing Requirements

Navigating a PRRB appeal requires strict adherence to deadlines and details:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Minimum Amount | $10,000 (individual) / $50,000 (group) |
| Filing Deadline | Within 180 days |
| Filing System | Office of Hearings Case and Document Management System (OH CDMS) |
| Documentation | Determination appealed, relevant adjustment documentation |

Success depends on presenting a well-supported case with clear evidence and strong arguments, in addition to meeting requirements.

### Life Cycle of a PRRB Appeal

After disagreeing with a Medicare reimbursement decision, the PRRB appeal progresses through several stages:

1. **Ensure Eligibility** – Disagreeing with a final determination, meeting minimum dispute amount, and filing within 180 days
2. **File Appeal** – Formal appeal with supporting documents filed electronically through OH CDMS
3. **Exchange Arguments** – Written arguments exchanged with the MAC
4. **Attend Hearing** – Hearing before a PRRB panel (various formats available)
5. **Receive Decision** – PRRB issues a written decision
6. **Further Appeals** – Providers can pursue reconsideration requests or federal court lawsuits

### Commonly Appealed PRRB Issues

Navigating the complexities of Medicare reimbursement can lead to disputes that appear before the PRRB. Hospitals facing appeals typically encounter a recurring set of issues:

#### 1. Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments

DSH payments are a critical source of funding for hospitals serving a high volume of low-income patients. These payments help offset the additional costs associated with treating this vulnerable population.

Calculating a hospital's **Disproportionate Patient Percentage (DPP)** is crucial for determining the DSH payment amount, as it considers the percentage of patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare.

Recent changes have added complexity to the calculation process by phasing out traditional DSH payments for uncompensated care payments. Disagreements between hospitals and Medicare contractors emphasize the need to understand DSH calculations and the appeals process.

#### 2. Graduate Medical Education (GME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME) Payments

These programs financially support hospitals in training future healthcare professionals.

**Common Dispute Areas:**
- Resident full-time equivalent (FTE) counts
- Available bed factors
- Weighting of resident FTEs beyond the initial residency period

**Key Case:** *Hershey Medical Center v. Becerra* – established precedent for resident FTE weighting appeals

#### 3. Nursing and Allied Health Education Costs

Nursing and Allied Health Education Costs are considered pass-through expenses for hospitals that operate their educational programs. The specific allowable costs (clinical vs. classroom) can differ based on whether the program is provider-operated.

> **Note:** Recent heightened scrutiny from CMS audits has made this a more frequent concern for hospitals.

#### 4. Medicare Bad Debt

When Medicare beneficiaries are unable to pay their copays and deductibles, hospitals can incur bad debt. However, to qualify for reimbursement, they must demonstrate:

- "Reasonable collection efforts"
- Adherence to the CMS "must bill" policy
- Documentation of financial hardship
